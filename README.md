# Sly_Mutation_Mod_Medley
This CDDA modification is an attempt to gently rejigger the basegame mutations by fixing a few bugs that prevent some mutations from being properly reached, others from not being used in their intended threshold, things like that.  This does not add anything new or attempt to rebalance beyond what is absolutely required.
